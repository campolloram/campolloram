- 👋 Hi, I’m Guillermo Campollo.
- 👀 I’m interested in web development backend/frontend, data and ML.
- 🌱 I’m currently using Python/Django/Flask, JS/React, docker, etc. I want to learn more about cloud computing specially using AWS (devops/data-engineer).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects with social impact and where I can work with people that help me to grow and viceversa.
